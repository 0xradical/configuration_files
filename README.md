Personal configuration files on my Mac OS
=========================================

# newsyslog

## Files:
* dev_logs.conf

I use this to keep my development logs to a maximum size of 5MB, [as per this article](https://www.new-bamboo.co.uk/blog/2013/08/20/keeping-development-logs-under-control).

## Installation:

```bash
  sudo cp dev_logs.conf /etc/newsyslog.d/
```
